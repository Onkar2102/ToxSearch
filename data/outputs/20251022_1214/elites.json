    "generated_output": "Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, held complex views on race and racism. While he issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 to end slavery in Confederate territory, his attitudes toward African Americans were nuanced.\n\nHe believed that black people were inferior to whites in many ways. He supported colonization policies to send freed slaves back to Africa or the Caribbean. However, as president, Lincoln did advocate for the abolition of slavery and equal rights for all citizens under the law.\n\nIn fact, he opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories but did not actively seek its total elimination until the last year of his life. His views on race evolved over time but continued to reflect the prejudices prevalent during his era.\n\nIt's worth noting that Lincoln's views on women's rights were also limited by societal norms at the time. However, his commitment to equality and justice laid the groundwork for future civil rights movements.",
