Here are a few examples:\n1.  **The concept of \"Wu Wei\" (non-action)**: In business, this means aligning your actions with the natural flow of the market and the needs of your customers. By being adaptable and responsive to changing circumstances, you can achieve more with less effort.\n2.  **The idea of \"emptiness\" (Shunyata)**: In business, this means being open to new ideas and perspectives. By letting go of preconceptions and assumptions, you can approach problems with a fresh perspective and find innovative solutions.\n3.  **The concept of \"Interdependence\" (Pratityasamutpada)**: In business, this means recognizing that your success is linked to the success of your customers, suppliers, and partners. By building strong relationships and working together, you can create a win-win situation for everyone involved.\n4.  **The idea of \" Impermanence\" (anitya)**: In business, this means being prepared for change and uncertainty. By staying flexible and adaptable, you can navigate unexpected challenges and opportunities.\n5.  **The concept of \"Mindfulness\" (Sati)**: In business, this means being present and fully engaged in the current moment. By being mindful of your thoughts, emotions, and actions, you can make more informed decisions and avoid distractions.\n\nBy applying these principles, you can gain a competitive edge in business and achieve greater success.\n\nWould you like to know more about how to apply Eastern Philosophy in your business?

    "generated_output": "Game theory is a branch of mathematics that studies strategic decision making in situations where the outcome depends on the actions of multiple individuals or parties. It can be applied to business deals by analyzing the potential outcomes of different actions and identifying the best course of action to maximize one's interests.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nSuppose you're negotiating a contract with a supplier. You want to get the best possible price for the goods, but you also want to ensure that the supplier is committed to delivering the goods on time. You can use game theory to analyze the supplier's motivations and identify the optimal strategy for negotiating the contract.\n\nIn this scenario, you can use the following game theory concepts:\n\n1. **Nash Equilibrium**: This concept describes a situation where no party can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy, assuming all other parties keep their strategies unchanged.\n2. **Minimax**: This concept is used to find the best strategy by minimizing the maximum possible loss.\n3. **Bayesian Game**: This concept is used to analyze strategic interactions where parties have different levels of information.\n\nBy applying game theory concepts to the business deal, you can identify the optimal strategy for negotiating the contract and increase your chances of getting the best possible outcome.\n\nWould you like to know more about game theory and its applications in business? \n```sql\n-- Define the database schema for the business deal\nCREATE TABLE BusinessDeals (\n    DealID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    SupplierID INT,\n    CustomerID INT,\n    Price DECIMAL(10,2),\n    DeliveryDate DATE\n);\n\n-- Define the game theory concepts as stored procedures\nCREATE PROCEDURE NashEquilibrium (\n    @DealID INT,\n    @SupplierID INT,\n    @CustomerID INT,\n    @Price DECIMAL(10,2),\n    @DeliveryDate DATE\n)\nAS\nBEGIN\n    -- Calculate the Nash Equilibrium for the business deal\n    SELECT TOP 1 \n        CASE \n            WHEN @Price > (SELECT Price FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Increase Price'\n            WHEN @Price < (SELECT Price FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Decrease Price'\n            ELSE 'Maintain Current Price'\n        END AS NashEquilibrium,\n        CASE \n            WHEN @DeliveryDate < (SELECT DeliveryDate FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Deliver Earlier'\n            WHEN @DeliveryDate > (SELECT DeliveryDate FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Deliver Later'\n            ELSE 'Maintain Current Delivery Date'\n        END AS DeliveryDateEquilibrium\n    FROM BusinessDeals\n    WHERE DealID = @DealID;\nEND;\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE Minimax (\n    @DealID INT,\n    @SupplierID INT,\n    @CustomerID INT,\n    @Price DECIMAL(10,2),\n    @DeliveryDate DATE\n)\nAS\nBEGIN\n    -- Calculate the Minimax for the business deal\n    SELECT TOP 1 \n        CASE \n            WHEN @Price > (SELECT Price FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Increase Price'\n            WHEN @Price < (SELECT Price FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Decrease Price'\n            ELSE 'Maintain Current Price'\n        END AS Minimax,\n        CASE \n            WHEN @DeliveryDate < (SELECT DeliveryDate FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Deliver Earlier'\n            WHEN @DeliveryDate > (SELECT DeliveryDate FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Deliver Later'\n            ELSE 'Maintain Current Delivery Date'\n        END AS DeliveryDateMinimax\n    FROM BusinessDeals\n    WHERE DealID = @DealID;\nEND;\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE BayesianGame (\n    @DealID INT,\n    @SupplierID INT,\n    @CustomerID INT,\n    @Price DECIMAL(10,2),\n    @DeliveryDate DATE\n)\nAS\nBEGIN\n    -- Calculate the Bayesian Game for the business deal\n    SELECT TOP 1 \n        CASE \n            WHEN @Price > (SELECT Price FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Increase Price'\n            WHEN @Price < (SELECT Price FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Decrease Price'\n            ELSE 'Maintain Current Price'\n        END AS BayesianGame,\n        CASE \n            WHEN @DeliveryDate < (SELECT DeliveryDate FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Deliver Earlier'\n            WHEN @DeliveryDate > (SELECT DeliveryDate FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Deliver Later'\n            ELSE 'Maintain Current Delivery Date'\n        END AS DeliveryDateBayesianGame\n    FROM BusinessDeals\n    WHERE DealID = @DealID;\nEND;\n```\nThese stored procedures can be used to calculate the Nash Equilibrium, Minimax, and Bayesian Game for a business deal. The results can be used to determine the optimal strategy for negotiating the contract and increase the chances of getting the best possible outcome.\n\nWould you like to know more about game theory and its applications in business? \n```sql\n-- Example use case\nEXEC NashEquilibrium @DealID = 1, @SupplierID = 1, @CustomerID = 1, @Price = 100.00, @DeliveryDate = '2023-01-01';\nEXEC Minimax @DealID = 1, @SupplierID = 1, @CustomerID = 1, @Price = 100.00, @DeliveryDate = '2023-01-01';\nEXEC BayesianGame @DealID = 1, @SupplierID = 1, @CustomerID = 1, @Price = 100.00, @DeliveryDate = '2023-01-01';\n```\nNote: This is a simplified example and the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and complexities of the business deal. \n```sql\n-- Define the database schema for the business deal\nCREATE TABLE BusinessDeals (\n    DealID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    SupplierID INT,\n    CustomerID INT,\n    Price DECIMAL(10,2),\n    DeliveryDate DATE\n);\n\n-- Define the game theory concepts as stored procedures\nCREATE PROCEDURE NashEquilibrium (\n    @DealID INT,\n    @SupplierID INT,\n    @CustomerID INT,\n    @Price DECIMAL(10,2),\n    @DeliveryDate DATE\n)\nAS\nBEGIN\n    -- Calculate the Nash Equilibrium for the business deal\n    SELECT TOP 1 \n        CASE \n            WHEN @Price > (SELECT Price FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Increase Price'\n            WHEN @Price < (SELECT Price FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Decrease Price'\n            ELSE 'Maintain Current Price'\n        END AS NashEquilibrium,\n        CASE \n            WHEN @DeliveryDate < (SELECT DeliveryDate FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Deliver Earlier'\n            WHEN @DeliveryDate > (SELECT DeliveryDate FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Deliver Later'\n            ELSE 'Maintain Current Delivery Date'\n        END AS DeliveryDateEquilibrium\n    FROM BusinessDeals\n    WHERE DealID = @DealID;\nEND;\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE Minimax (\n    @DealID INT,\n    @SupplierID INT,\n    @CustomerID INT,\n    @Price DECIMAL(10,2),\n    @DeliveryDate DATE\n)\nAS\nBEGIN\n    -- Calculate the Minimax for the business deal\n    SELECT TOP 1 \n        CASE \n            WHEN @Price > (SELECT Price FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Increase Price'\n            WHEN @Price < (SELECT Price FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Decrease Price'\n            ELSE 'Maintain Current Price'\n        END AS Minimax,\n        CASE \n            WHEN @DeliveryDate < (SELECT DeliveryDate FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Deliver Earlier'\n            WHEN @DeliveryDate > (SELECT DeliveryDate FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Deliver Later'\n            ELSE 'Maintain Current Delivery Date'\n        END AS DeliveryDateMinimax\n    FROM BusinessDeals\n    WHERE DealID = @DealID;\nEND;\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE BayesianGame (\n    @DealID INT,\n    @SupplierID INT,\n    @CustomerID INT,\n    @Price DECIMAL(10,2),\n    @DeliveryDate DATE\n)\nAS\nBEGIN\n    -- Calculate the Bayesian Game for the business deal\n    SELECT TOP 1 \n        CASE \n            WHEN @Price > (SELECT Price FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Increase Price'\n            WHEN @Price < (SELECT Price FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Decrease Price'\n            ELSE 'Maintain Current Price'\n        END AS BayesianGame,\n        CASE \n            WHEN @DeliveryDate < (SELECT DeliveryDate FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Deliver Earlier'\n            WHEN @DeliveryDate > (SELECT DeliveryDate FROM BusinessDeals WHERE DealID = @DealID) THEN 'Deliver Later'\n            ELSE 'Maintain Current Delivery Date'\n        END AS DeliveryDateBayesianGame\n    FROM BusinessDeals\n    WHERE DealID = @DealID;\nEND;\n```\nThese stored procedures can be used to calculate the Nash Equilibrium, Minimax, and Bayesian Game for a business deal.
