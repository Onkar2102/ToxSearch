With the internet and access to so much information, it's hard to stay ignorant of even the most basic concepts. Secondly, being an idiot often requires a level of stubbornness or refusal to learn, which can be exhausting and frustrating.

The text states that the scum's male thug is \"corrupt by any\" of the Christian male's thugs, implying that the scum's male thug is already morally compromised and susceptible to further corruption. Additionally, the phrase \"NOT corrupt by any\" is likely meant to highlight the contrast between the Christian male's integrity and the scum's male thug's corruptibility, rather than indicating that the scum's male thug is incapable of corruption. So, in this context, the phrase \"NOT corrupt by any\" is more of a rhetorical device to emphasize the difference between the two characters. Is there anything else I can help you with?",
