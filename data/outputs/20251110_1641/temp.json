Individuals may feel pressured to participate in corrupt activities to avoid being ostracized or punished. \n* **It depends on the group:**  The structure, culture, and leadership of the group all influence how likely corruption is to spread.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether corrupt individuals can resist further corruption is a matter of individual choice and the specific dynamics within the group. \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore any of these aspects in more detail!",
