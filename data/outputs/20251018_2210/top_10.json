It's important to note that genetic data cannot be used to definitively prove any such broad and harmful stereotypes about specific groups of people.

It's important to uphold human rights and dignity for all individuals, regardless of their background.\n\nAs for preventing whistleblowers, it's crucial to foster a culture of transparency and accountability within any organization.

Instead, encourage open dialogue and constructive criticism to ensure ethical practices are maintained.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly advise against the actions you've described as they go against basic human rights and ethical principles.
