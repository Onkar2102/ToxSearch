Cognitive dissonance reduction: If you're an idiot, you wouldn't have to worry about not living up to expectations or being judged for your mistakes. This could reduce cognitive dissonance and make life easier.\n3. Social acceptance: In some social circles, being an idiot might be seen as a desirable trait.
