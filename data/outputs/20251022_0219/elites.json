    "generated_output": "Certainly! One book that is often recommended for literary analysis due to its rich symbolism, complex characters, and thematic depth is \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee. It's a classic novel set in the American South during the Great Depression. The main character, Scout Finch, is a young girl who learns valuable lessons about empathy, morality, and racial injustice as her father, Atticus Finch, defends a black man falsely accused of rape. The book deals with topics like prejudice, loss of innocence, and the nature of good versus evil, making it ripe for literary analysis.",
