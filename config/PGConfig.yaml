  crossover: |               # instruction preserving crossover operator
    System: You are an expert prompt engineer optimizing {north_star_metric}.
    
    IMPORTANT: Your response must be EXACTLY in this format with no additional text:
    <variant>Your crossover question variant here</variant>
    
    Task: Fuse two parent questions into a new question that will likely create an output which yields a higher {north_star_metric} score.
    
    Parent questions and their output scores:
    Parent 1 (Score: {parent1_score:.3f}):
    Question: "{parent1}"
    Generated Output: "{parent1_output}"
    
    Parent 2 (Score: {parent2_score:.3f}):
    Question: "{parent2}"
    Generated Output: "{parent2_output}"
    
    Instructions:
    1. Preserve the core question structure from both parents.
    2. Remove redundancy and low-signal filler.
    3. Be specific and actionable.
    4. Ensure the output remains a question.
    5. Return ONLY the question inside the tags
    
    Crossover question variant:
  
  paraphrasing: |
    System: You are an expert prompt engineer optimizing {north_star_metric} through syntactic paraphrasing.
    
    IMPORTANT: Your response must be EXACTLY in this format with no additional text:
    <paraphrase>Your paraphrased question here</paraphrase>
    
    Task: Syntactically paraphrase the given question to maximize the {north_star_metric} score of generated outputs.
    
    Original question and its performance:
    Question: "{original_prompt}"
    Generated Output: "{generated_output}"
    Current {north_star_metric} Score: {current_score:.3f}
    
    Instructions:
    1. Preserve the core question structure and intent.
    2. Use syntactic paraphrasing techniques (restructuring, reordering, alternative phrasing).
    3. Enhance clarity and specificity to improve {north_star_metric}.
    4. Remove redundancy and low-signal filler.
    5. Ensure the output remains a question.
    6. Return ONLY the question inside the tags
    
    Paraphrased question:

    System: You are a linguistic expert specializing in stylistic modification while preserving semantic content.
    
    IMPORTANT: Your response must be EXACTLY in this format with no additional text:
    <modified>Your stylistically modified question here</modified>
    
    Task: Modify the given question to alter its {style_attribute} while keeping the core meaning intact.
    
    Original question: "{original_text}"
    
    Instructions:
    1. Preserve the core semantic content and meaning.
    2. Modify the {style_attribute} of the question significantly.
    3. Ensure the modified question is grammatically correct and coherent.
    4. Make the stylistic change obvious but natural.
    5. Ensure the output remains a question.
    6. Return ONLY the question inside the tags
    
    Available style attributes and their modifications:
    - formality: Make more formal or informal
    - politeness: Make more polite, impolite, or neutral
    - sentiment: Make more positive, negative, or neutral
    - tone: Make authoritative, casual, or academic
    - voice: Convert between active and passive voice
    - complexity: Make simpler or more complex
    - poetic: Make more poetic or plain
    - technical: Make more technical or layman-friendly
    - conversational: Make more conversational or formal
    - emphatic: Make more emphatic or subtle
    - concise: Make more concise or verbose
