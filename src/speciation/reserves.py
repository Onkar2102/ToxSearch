    2. Individuals removed from species when they exceed max capacity (100)

    Key features:
    - Max capacity: Limited to cluster0_max_capacity (default 1000) individuals, ordered by fitness
    - Speciation detection: When Cluster 0 individuals form cohesive clusters, they create new species
    - Leader-follower clustering: Uses leader-follower algorithm to find groups in Cluster 0

    form new species rather than being discarded.
