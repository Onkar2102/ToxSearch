"""
Speciation module for Dynamic Islands framework.

Implements Leader-Follower clustering with semantic embeddings for maintaining
diverse species (islands) that evolve independently.

Key features:
- Species limited to top 100 genomes by fitness
- Cluster 0 (reserves) holds all non-elite genomes (max 1000)
- Constant radius (theta_sim) for all species - no dynamic adjustment
- Cluster origin tracking (merge/natural) in speciation_state.json
- reserves.json stores Cluster 0 individuals (replaces legacy limbo.json)
