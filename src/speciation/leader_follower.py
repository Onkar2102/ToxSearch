    Leader-Follower clustering algorithm that reads and writes files directly.
    
    This function uses DEFERRED SPECIES ID ASSIGNMENT (adaptive to min_island_size):
    - Species IDs are only assigned when a leader gains enough followers to reach min_island_size
    - Individuals that don't fit existing species become "potential leaders"
    - Potential leaders become actual species only when they have (min_island_size - 1) followers
    - Potential leaders without enough followers stay in cluster 0 (reserves)
    
    This ensures:
    - No wasted species IDs
    - No species smaller than min_island_size
    - Species inherently have minimum size of min_island_size
    
    Pipeline:
    1. Reads genomes from temp.json (must have prompt_embedding field)
    2. Reads existing species from speciation_state.json (if exists)
    3. For Generation 0 (no species exist) – two-phase via Gen0Clustering:
       - Phase 1: Process entire population; build all (potential_leader, followers) groups.
         First = potential leader; each subsequent joins nearest potential leader within theta_sim
         or becomes a new potential leader. No species created during this pass.
       - Phase 2: For each group with |leader ∪ followers| >= min_island_size: set leader =
         argmax fitness, keep only valid_members with d(m, leader) < theta_sim; if
         |valid_members| >= min_island_size create Species, else all → reserves. Smaller
         groups → all to reserves.
    4. For Generation N:
       - Checks each genome against existing species leaders
       - If within theta_sim, assigns to that species
       - If not, and skip_cluster0_outliers=False, checks against cluster 0 outliers (from reserves.json) as potential leaders
       - If within theta_sim of an outlier, add as follower (tracked but no species yet)
       - When a potential leader has (min_island_size - 1) followers, species forms
       - If not within radius of any leader or outlier, adds to cluster 0
       - If skip_cluster0_outliers=True, all unassigned variants go directly to cluster 0 (no outlier checking)
       - check_speciation() handles additional species formation from remaining cluster 0 individuals
    5. Updates temp.json with species_id for each genome
    6. Updates speciation_state.json with new species structure
