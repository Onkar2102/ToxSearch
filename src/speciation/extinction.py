    Process species freezing and move small species to cluster 0.
    
    Freezing Logic:
    - A species becomes frozen when it was selected as parent for species_stagnation generations
      and didn't improve its highest fitness in any of those generations.
    - The stagnation counter increments only when species is selected as parent AND no improvement.
    - When stagnation >= species_stagnation, the species is frozen (EXTINCTION - tracked separately).
    
    Actions:
    1. Freeze species with stagnation >= species_stagnation (EXTINCTION - tracked separately)
    2. Move species with count < min_size to cluster 0 (NOT extinction - tracked separately)
       - Species moved to cluster 0 get state="incubator" and are preserved in speciation_state.json
       - The species ID is considered deceased (new species from cluster 0 get new IDs)
    
    No repopulation is needed - clustering will handle new species formation.
    
    Args:
        species: Dict of species (modified in-place)
        cluster0: Cluster 0 (reserves) for small species
        current_generation: Current generation number
        species_stagnation: Maximum stagnation before freezing (number of times selected as parent without improvement)
        min_size: Minimum species size (below this, move to cluster 0)
        logger: Optional logger instance
    
    Returns:
        Tuple of (updated_species, extinction_events, moved_to_cluster0_events, incubator_species)
        - extinction_events: Only frozen species (stagnation-based)
        - moved_to_cluster0_events: Species moved to cluster 0 (size-based, NOT extinction)
        - incubator_species: Dict of species moved to incubator state (for preservation in historical_species)
